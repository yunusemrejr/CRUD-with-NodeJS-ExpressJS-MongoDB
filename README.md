Usage notes:

1. This project uses MongoDB atlas which is NOT localhost and therefore in your .env file right below your "PORT=" you must create a variable for mongoDB and specify your username and password within it in order to connect it to your desired database in mongo.

2. If you are editing or running the project within VSC, be sure that you have necessary plug-ins that the project requires and that they are up-to-date.
